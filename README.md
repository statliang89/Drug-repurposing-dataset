# Literature data-based de novo candidates for drug repurposing

This dataset supports the study “Literature Data-Driven Novel Candidates for Drug Repurposing”. <br>
To reduce file size, the ‘Tables’ folder has been compressed prior to upload. The archive (Tables.zip) contains several spreadsheets: Drug_Pairs_Common_Targets.xls, Drug_Repurposing_Candidates.xls, Drug_targets.xls, Drug_Validation_Set.xls, and Jaccard_Coefficient_Result.xls. <br>
These files provide the underlying data for the analyses and results presented in the study and serve as supplementary material to support transparency, reproducibility, and reuse in research on drug repurposing and computational drug discovery. <br> 
Users should decompress the archive before use. <br>
